## About

BOT Feedy is a Discord bot built with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) & [Distube](https://distube.js.org/#/) libraries. It's a personal project mainly for my own and my friends servers, so there won't be an invite link for the bot, but feel free to use the source code to create your own copy. :)

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.6.0 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

- Create a local repository on your machine
- Clone the project https://github.com/matcvet/BOT-Feedy.git
- Use <b>npm install</b> command inside project folder
- Create <b>config.js</b> file and copy properties from <b>config.example.js</b> file <br>
> NOTE: Make sure you get all the required tokens for the bot to fully work
- Use <b>node index.js</b> in root directory to start the bot
